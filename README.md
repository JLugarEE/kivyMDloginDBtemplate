# kivyMDloginDBtemplate
Want to offer a versatile kivyMD login template that uses DB and individual screen (*.kv) and source (*.py) files.

While learning Python with the kivy and kivyMD GUI packages/APIs I was miffed that many came close to shaping a
very good template for modularizing the GUI/Python codes. But it was only one upcoming developer that did it both
cleanly and  precisely. Let me (re)introduce you to Eric Sandberg, @ https://github.com/Dirk-Sandberg 

On December 24th, 2020 he helped with modularizing three screens in this repo: 
https://github.com/JLugarEE/2020noBuilderStringMultiKvfiles.git

This morning Dec 29th, I attempted to merge his kivyMD login template @ 
https://github.com/Dirk-Sandberg/FirebaseLoginScreen.git

I have made this repo in hopes to make the template more modular.

I recommend you sub-scribe/watch/pull; this will change mobile landscape in 2021.
